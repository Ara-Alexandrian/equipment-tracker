Equipment Calibration Reminder
============================

Hello from Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center,

This is a reminder that the following equipment items are due for calibration soon:

{% for item in equipment %}
- {{ item.id }} ({{ item.manufacturer }} {{ item.model }})
  Type: {{ item.equipment_type }}
  Calibration Due: {{ item.calibration_due_date }}
  {% if item.days_until_due == 1 %}
  Status: Due tomorrow
  {% else %}
  Status: Due in {{ item.days_until_due }} days
  {% endif %}

{% endfor %}

Please ensure that arrangements are made for calibration to avoid equipment being out of compliance.
