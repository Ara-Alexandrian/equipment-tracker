## Overview

The transport request system is a feature of GearVue that allows users to request the movement of equipment between locations. This guide explains how to use the system and its key features.

## Key Features

- **Request Equipment Transport**: Create transport requests for equipment that needs to be moved
- **QR Code Integration**: Scan equipment QR codes to quickly create transport requests from mobile devices
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor the status of transport requests through their lifecycle
- **Roles & Permissions**: Different user roles have different capabilities within the system
- **Comment System**: Communication thread for each transport request
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile access

## Transport Request Lifecycle

A transport request goes through the following stages:

1. **Requested**: Initial request submitted by any user
2. **Approved**: Request approved by a physicist or admin
3. **Scheduled**: Transport date and details confirmed
4. **In Transit**: Equipment is currently being transported
5. **Completed**: Transport has been successfully completed
6. **Cancelled**: Request was cancelled (terminal state)

## Creating Transport Requests

### Via QR Code (Recommended for Mobile Users)

1. Scan the equipment's QR code with a mobile device
2. Click the "Request Transport" button
3. Fill in the destination, date, and other details
4. Tap "Submit Transport Request"

### Via Equipment Detail Page (When Logged In)

1. Navigate to the equipment detail page
2. Click the "Request Transport" button in the top right
3. Fill in the destination, date, and other details
4. Click "Create Transport Request"

### For Calibration Transport

When equipment is approaching its calibration due date, a "Schedule Calibration Transport" button appears on the equipment detail page.

## Viewing and Managing Transport Requests

### Transport Dashboard

The Transport Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all transport requests:

- **Pending Requests**: All requests that require attention
- **Upcoming (7 Days)**: Transports scheduled in the next week
- **My Requests**: Requests you've created
- **I'm Coordinating**: Requests you're responsible for (physicists/admins only)

### Equipment Detail Page

The equipment detail page now includes a "Transport Requests" tab showing all transport history for that item.

## User Roles

### Regular Users Can:
- Create transport requests
- View status of their requests
- Cancel their own pending requests
- Add comments to any transport request

### Physicists and Administrators Can Also:
- Approve or decline transport requests
- Schedule approved requests
- Update request status
- View all transport requests
- Cancel any request

## QR Code Transportation Workflow

The zero-friction workflow for equipment transport is as follows:

1. User scans QR code attached to equipment
2. Landing page shows equipment details and the "Request Transport" button
3. User fills in minimal information (name, destination, and requested date)
4. Request is immediately visible to physicists for approval
5. User can scan QR code again later to check request status

## Tips for Effective Transport Management

1. **Clear Instructions**: When creating a request, provide detailed instructions in the "Special Instructions" field for any handling requirements
2. **Plan Ahead**: Request equipment transport at least 48 hours in advance when possible
3. **Check Status**: Regularly check the status of your transport requests
4. **Comments**: Use the comment system to communicate about specific requests
5. **Mobile Access**: Use the QR code system for quick and easy access on the go

## Benefits

- **Reduced Friction**: Mobile-friendly QR code access removes barriers to requesting transport
- **Better Tracking**: Complete visibility into equipment movements
- **Improved Coordination**: Clear communication and responsibility assignment
- **Calibration Planning**: Integration with calibration due dates for better planning
- **Reduced Email Traffic**: Centralized system reduces need for email coordination
