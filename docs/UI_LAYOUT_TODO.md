# UI Layout Improvements TODO

This document tracks needed improvements to the wider layout implementation.

## Current Status
We've implemented wider default container sizes and responsive behavior, but several issues remain:

- Some UI elements are colliding in the wider layout
- Button styling needs refinement for better visual appearance
- Mobile responsiveness needs comprehensive testing and improvements

## Needed Improvements

### Layout Fixes
- [ ] Fix collision between UI elements in wider layouts
- [ ] Better handle tables that expand beyond their containers
- [ ] Fix modal dialog positioning and widths in wider layouts
- [ ] Ensure all containers properly use the width classes

### Button Styling
- [ ] Standardize button spacing and sizing
- [ ] Fix action button alignment and overflow issues
- [ ] Improve button visibility and clickability on mobile

### Responsive Behavior
- [ ] Complete mobile layout optimization
- [ ] Add proper breakpoints for different device sizes
- [ ] Test on various devices and screen sizes
- [ ] Implement collapsible tables for very small screens

### Additional Enhancements
- [ ] Consider dark theme adjustments for wider layouts
- [ ] Add proper table scrolling behavior for very wide tables

## Implementation Plan
We will address these issues in the next development session, focusing first on fixing UI element collisions and ensuring proper responsive behavior.
